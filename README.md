This project is one of the homeworks for an Artificial Intellifence class I took at UW-Madison in the fall of 2020.

The goals of the projects were: 

1. Getting PyTorch environment set up
2. Creating a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the predesigned architecture for working with the famous MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
3. Designing a deep neural network architecture for a recognition of scenes in the MIT MiniPlaces dataset
